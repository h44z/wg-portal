> :warning: **IMPORTANT** Version 2 is currently under development and may contain bugs. It is currently not advised to use this version
in production. Use version [v1](https://github.com/h44z/wg-portal/tree/stable) instead.

Since the project was accepted by the Docker-Sponsored Open Source Program, the Docker image location has moved to: https://hub.docker.com/r/wgportal/wg-portal.
Please update the Docker image from **h44z/wg-portal** to **wgportal/wg-portal**.

A simple, web based configuration portal for [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com).
The portal uses the WireGuard [wgctrl](https://github.com/WireGuard/wgctrl-go) library to manage existing VPN
interfaces. This allows for seamless activation or deactivation of new users, without disturbing existing VPN
connections.

The configuration portal supports using a database (SQLite, MySQL, MsSQL or Postgres), OAuth or LDAP (Active Directory or OpenLDAP) as a user source for authentication and profile data.


## Features
 * Self-hosted - the whole application is a single binary
 * Responsive web UI written in Vue.JS
 * Automatically select IP from the network pool assigned to client
 * QR-Code for convenient mobile client configuration
 * Sent email to client with QR-code and client config
 * Enable / Disable clients seamlessly
 * Generation of wg-quick configuration file (`wgX.conf`) if required
 * User authentication (database, OAuth or LDAP) 
 * IPv6 ready
 * Docker ready
 * Can be used with existing WireGuard setups
 * Support for multiple WireGuard interfaces
 * Peer Expiry Feature
 * Handle route and DNS settings like wg-quick does
 * ~~REST API for management and client deployment~~ (coming soon)

## Configuration
You can configure WireGuard Portal using a yaml configuration file.
The filepath of the yaml configuration file defaults to **config/config.yml** in the working directory of the executable.
It is possible to override the configuration filepath using the environment variable **WG_PORTAL_CONFIG**.
For example: `WG_PORTAL_CONFIG=/home/test/config.yml ./wg-portal-amd64`.

By default, WireGuard Portal uses a SQLite database. The database is stored in **data/sqlite.db** in the working directory of the executable.

### Configuration Options
The following configuration options are available:

## Upgrading from V1

> :warning: Before upgrading from V1, make sure that you have a backup of your currently working configuration files and database!

To start the upgrade process, start the wg-portal binary with the **-migrateFrom** parameter. 
The configuration (config.yml) for WireGuard Portal must be updated and valid before starting the upgrade.

To upgrade from a previous SQLite database, start wg-portal like:

```shell
./wg-portal-amd64 -migrateFrom=old_wg_portal.db
```

You can also specify the database type using the parameter **-migrateFromType**, supported types: mysql, mssql, postgres or sqlite.
For example:

```shell
./wg-portal-amd64 -migrateFromType=mysql -migrateFrom=user:pass@tcp(1.2.3.4:3306)/dbname?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local
```

The upgrade will transform the old, existing database and store the values in the new database specified in config.yml.
Ensure that the new database does not contain any data!


## V2 TODOs
 * Public REST API
 * Translations
 * Documentation
 * Audit UI


## Building

To build a standalone application, use the Makefile provided in the repository. 
Go version 1.22 or higher has to be installed to build WireGuard Portal. 
If you want to re-compile the frontend, NodeJS 18 and NPM >= 9 is required.

```shell
# build the frontend
make frontend

# build the binary
make build
```

## What is out of scope
 * Automatic generation or application of any `iptables` or `nftables` rules.
 * Support for operating systems other than linux.
 * Automatic import of private keys of an existing WireGuard setup.


## Application stack

 * [wgctrl-go](https://github.com/WireGuard/wgctrl-go) and [netlink](https://github.com/vishvananda/netlink) for interface handling
 * [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin), HTTP web framework written in Go
 * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), for the HTML templates
 * [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/), for the frontend
