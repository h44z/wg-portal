## Introduction
<!-- Text from this line # is included in docs/documentation/overview.md -->
**WireGuard Portal** is a simple, web-based configuration portal for [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com) server management.
The portal uses the WireGuard [wgctrl](https://github.com/WireGuard/wgctrl-go) library to manage existing VPN
interfaces. This allows for the seamless activation or deactivation of new users without disturbing existing VPN
connections.

The configuration portal supports using a database (SQLite, MySQL, MsSQL, or Postgres), OAuth or LDAP
(Active Directory or OpenLDAP) as a user source for authentication and profile data.

## Features

* Self-hosted - the whole application is a single binary
* Responsive multi-language web UI written in Vue.js
* Automatically selects IP from the network pool assigned to the client
* QR-Code for convenient mobile client configuration
* Sends email to the client with QR-code and client config
* Enable / Disable clients seamlessly
* Generation of wg-quick configuration file (`wgX.conf`) if required
* User authentication (database, OAuth, or LDAP), Passkey support
* IPv6 ready
* Docker ready
* Can be used with existing WireGuard setups
* Support for multiple WireGuard interfaces
* Peer Expiry Feature
* Handles route and DNS settings like wg-quick does
* Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring and alerting
* REST API for management and client deployment
* Webhook for custom actions on peer, interface, or user updates
